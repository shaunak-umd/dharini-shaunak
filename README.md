### `DataWiz - Magic is Everywhere`
Exploring the wizarding world using data and code

We have visualized data sets from the Harry Potter franchise in our project. We have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with ReactJs framework for the website and the D3.js library to visualize the data we have chosen.


Visualizations used:
1. Number of wizards born in each month - using a bar chart
2. Wizards and their eye colors -  using a bubble chart
3. Number of witches enrolled in Hogwarts so far - using a scatterplot
4. Witches and Wizards at Hogwarts by their ancestry - using a circle packing
